Because I'm tired of rewriting makefiles

## One repo to rule them all...

I have decided to take coding a little bit more seriously. And so I have realized that across most of my project there is a certain pattern to be found.
Same makefile, same functions being rewritten, same .h file structures...

Not anymore.
With my magic coding powers and the help of Bash-senpai I will finally triumph.
